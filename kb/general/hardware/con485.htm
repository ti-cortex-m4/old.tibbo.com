<div class="level1">

<p>

<strong>Question:</strong> How do I connect a DS100B to a GigaTMS Con485 device?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Answer:</strong> The Con485 is a converter between RS232 and RS485 produced by <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.gigatms.com.tw/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.gigatms.com.tw/'" tppabs="http://www.gigatms.com.tw/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.gigatms.com.tw"  rel="nofollow">GigaTMS</a>. This article covers how to connect it to the DS100B for testing purposes.

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> First, set a baudrate on the Con485. For example, select 9600.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Make sure this baudrate is set also for the DS. This can be done in settings, or using on-the-fly commands when you open the connection.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Flow Control must be “Idle or Remote”, since there is no RTS/CTS in RS485.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Next, make sure “serial interface” is “2- automatic”.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Set SW1 and SW2 on the back of the DS100B to ON.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Reboot the DS.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Attach a TB100 adaptor to the DS100B.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> RS485 consists of two wires: + and -. There is no ground. TB100 allows for a 4-wire interface - full duplex with two pairs, TX+/- and RX+/-. But Con485 requires only two wires. So, for the DS100B to work properly, you need to connect RX+ to TX+ and RX- to TX-. This turns a 4-wire interface into a 2-wire interface. To do this, just turn on SW1 and SW2 on the TB100, and you&#039;re done.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Now all you need to do is connect the TB100 to the Con485 using two wires. On the screw pins of the TB100 you will find TX+/- and RX+/-. Since SW1 and SW2 is on, we only need to connect one of these pairs. Connect RX+/-, for example. These are pins 6 and 7.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> So, take two wires and connect this RS485+ and RS485- of the Con485. <strong>Plus goes to plus, minus goes to minus.</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> That&#039;s it for the 485 connections. Simple!</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The next step is to connect the Con485 to the RS232 port of the computer, to see if it works. This sounds trivial, but you should <strong>really</strong> pay attention to the RX/TX pin assignment on the Con485, because on this specific device it can be a bit confusing. Read the manual carefully! Make sure you connect the TX of the Con485 to the RX of the computer, and the RX to the TX. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> You should now be able to run HyperTerminal and see it work.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="level2">

<p>
This is because the line is not terminated in this example. Rs485 lines should be properly terminated. On the TB100, just turn ON switch 5 or 6 (but not both!). Now you have to make sure the other end of the line is proerly terminated.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Then buy one!
</p>

<p>
Seriously – it will make your life much easier when creating such setups. It&#039;s not an expensive connector.
</p>

<p>
If for some reason you really can&#039;t buy one, then use a female DB9 connector and solder the lines – RX- to TX- and RX+ to TX+ according to the DS100B pinout <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://docs.tibbo.com/soism/ds100_ser.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://docs.tibbo.com/soism/ds100_ser.htm'" tppabs="http://docs.tibbo.com/soism/ds100_ser.htm" class="urlextern" title="http://docs.tibbo.com/soism/ds100_ser.htm"  rel="nofollow">here</a>. But then you&#039;ll have a problem with termination for longer-distance lines – you will have to solder in the termination components yourself. We really advise working with a TB100.
