<div class="level1">

<p>

<strong>Question:</strong> I think my hardware is malfunctioning. What should I do?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Answer:</strong> About 50% of all “malfunctioning” devices returned to Tibbo actually have *no* hardware problems. Here is what to do when you suspect that your DS100/EM100 is defective.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="step_1make_sure_that_the_problem_is_really_a_hardware_problem" id="step_1make_sure_that_the_problem_is_really_a_hardware_problem">STEP 1: Make sure that the problem is really a hardware problem</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>

There are several possible levels of hardware malfunction. Select the one matching your case from the list below and perform recommended checks:
</p>

<p>
<strong>(1)</strong> The DS100/EM100 appears to be completely “dead”. Dead here means that Status and Ethernet LEDs of the DS100/EM100 are always off, even if the device is powered. (Note: EM100 doesn&#039;t have the LEDs, only the control pins to connect those LEDs so this refers to the LEDs that may be provided on the board on which the EM100 is installed). Things to check:
</p>

<p>
Make sure that the device is properly powered. We have had numerous cases when the Customer was using the DS100 with an incorrect power supply (6V instead of 12V, alternative current instead of direct current, etc.). In case of the EM100 make sure that it receives a proper +5V (+/-5%) DC power. If possible, make sure that a proper power-on-reset is also supplied (reset is an active high pulse of at least 100ms duration).
</p>

<p>
If you are sure that the DS100/EM100 is properly powered but the device still appears to be dead, proceed to STEP2.
</p>

<p>
<strong>(2)</strong> The DS100/EM100 is not completely dead but the Red Status LED is showing one of the two error patterns: <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2'" tppabs="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2" class="urlextern" title="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2"  rel="nofollow">error1</a>, <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12'" tppabs="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12" class="urlextern" title="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12"  rel="nofollow">error2</a> or the device is not accessible through the Ethernet and/or serial port, or there is some other problem. In many cases the problem is actually caused by one of the following:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A bug in the outdated firmware used by the device</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Incorrect setup of the DS100/EM100. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Try doing the following:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If your EM100/DS100 is running an outdated firmware do upgrade to our latest firmware. You can always get the most recent firmware <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tibbo.com/downloads.php  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tibbo.com/downloads.php'" tppabs="http://www.tibbo.com/downloads.php" class="urlextern" title="http://www.tibbo.com/downloads.php"  rel="nofollow">here</a>. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Re-initialize the EM100/DS100. We have had cases when a strong electrostatic discharge (ESD) corrupted the internal Settings of the EM100/DS100 causing it to malfunction. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

After the firmware upgrade and reinitialization the DS100/EM100 is supposed to show the <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=0'" tppabs="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=0" class="urlextern" title="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=0"  rel="nofollow">powerup pattern</a>. If this doesn&#039;t happen and some other “strange” pattern is played or if <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2'" tppabs="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2" class="urlextern" title="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=2"  rel="nofollow">error1</a> or <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12'" tppabs="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12" class="urlextern" title="http://soi.tibbo.com/extras/leds.html?presel=12"  rel="nofollow">error2</a> pattern is still displayed, or if the DS100/EM100 still cannot be accessed through the Ethernet and/or serial port then this means that the DS100/EM100 really may have some sort of a hardware malfunction. In this case proceed to STEP2.
