<h1><a name="multi-destination_system_a_single_ds100em100_sends_the_data_to_several_other_ds100sem100s" id="multi-destination_system_a_single_ds100em100_sends_the_data_to_several_other_ds100sem100s">Multi-destination system (a single DS100/EM100 sends the data to several other DS100s/EM100s)</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>

<strong>Question:</strong> Can I make a Device Server send data to several other DS100s, all at the same time?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes – this is possible.
</p>

<p>
As an example you can imagine a system of several network-enabled clocks that are kept synchronized by a single timekeeping source. This source sends updating messages and it is important that those messages reach the clocks at exactly the same time (or with minimum time deviations).
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need to use DS100/EM100 firmware V3.11 or higher. This firmware supports certain new features that make multi-destination data transmissions possible.
</p>

<p>
Second, multi-destination data transmission can only be effected by using the UDP/IP transport protocol and sending UDP datagrams as broadcasts. Using TCP/IP is not possible IN PRINCIPLE because, by definition, the TCP/IP is a point-to-point protocol so “conference calls” are not possible with it. And the DS100/EM100 only allows for a SINGLE TCP/IP connection to be established at a time. Some of our Customers have suggested that, instead of using UDP broadcasts one can simply set the same IP-address in several DS100s/EM100s that must receive the data. This is a *very bad idea* and we strongly advise against using it!
</p>

<p>
To send broadcast data messages:

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  Set the Transport Protocol (TP) Setting of all participating DS100s/EM100s to UDP/IP</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  Set the Destination IP-address (DI) Setting of the <em>sending</em> DS100/EM100 to 255.255.255.255</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  Set the Broadcast UDP (BU) Setting of all <em>receiving</em> DS100s/EM100s to 1 (enabled). If this is not done the DS100/EM100 will ignore the UDP/IP packets sent in the broadcast mode (and this is a way to <em>prevent</em> certain DS100s/EM100s from receiving the data). </div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<h2><a name="potential_pitfalls" id="potential_pitfalls">Potential Pitfalls</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Such a system is not without its weak points:

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Delivery of messages is not reliable. There is no 100% guarantee that all UDP datagrams will be able to reach all destination DS100s/EM100s each time. In our example (the clock synchronization) this is not so important because it is OK to lose a certain percentage of the synchronizing messages.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Broadcasts, by their nature, cannot pass through the routers (bridges, firewall, etc.) and hence can only reach the DS100s/EM100s located on the same network segment with the sender. </div>
</li>
</ul>
